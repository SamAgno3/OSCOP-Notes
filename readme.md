Hey there,

Thanks for checking this out. My intention with this is to share the notes that I use the most rather than all of my writing during my years of learning. These notes are to be referenced when you are stuck in a particular part of the exploitation process. For more general notes, I would recommend using [Sushant747's Notes](https://sushant747.gitbooks.io/total-oscp-guide/content/) and [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme)

My notes are split into 3 sections. The Priv Esc sections are split by OS and are self explanatory. The miscellaneous notes section covers things that you can try when you find yourself stuck during a box. It's the one that I find the most useful when stuck down rabbit holes and without an idea where to go. Something there always helps out and lets me move in a new direction.

I hope you find these useful.
